I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/henderson-maggie.html">Psychology Department</a> and <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ni/">Neuroscience Institute</a> at CMU, also affiliated with the <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning Department</a>. Prior to this, I was a postdoc at CMU, working with Leila Wehbe and Michael Tarr. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Biological Sciences from Cornell University, then obtained my Ph.D. in Neurosciences from the University of California, San Diego, where I worked with John Serences.

	I am from Tbilisi, Georgia (the country). I’m interested in how the human mind and brain represent concepts and build semantic maps. Specifically, I’d like to explore conceptual representations across visual, linguistic, and other modalities in the brain. I aim to use computational modeling and fMRI to study this topic. Fun fact: I can lick my elbow (rare ability)!
