	<b>Maggie Henderson</b>		
	<br>
		
	I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/henderson-maggie.html">Psychology Department</a> and <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ni/">Neuroscience Institute</a> at CMU, also affiliated with the <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning Department</a>. Prior to this, I was a postdoc at CMU, working with Leila Wehbe and Michael Tarr. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Biological Sciences from Cornell University, then obtained my Ph.D. in Neurosciences from the University of California, San Diego, where I worked with John Serences. Outside the lab, I enjoy going for hikes around the Pittsburgh area, and playing with my cat Chamomile.

	<i>PhD program in Cognitive Neuroscience</i>
	<br>
	I am from Tbilisi, Georgia (the country). I’m interested in how the human mind and brain represent concepts and build semantic maps. Specifically, I’d like to explore conceptual representations across visual, linguistic, and other modalities in the brain. I aim to use computational modeling and fMRI to study this topic. Fun fact: I can lick my elbow (rare ability)!

	<br>
	My research focuses on visual cognition, especially in how perceptual representations interact with attention, memory, and higher-order cognitive processes. Outside of research, I love photography, and you can almost always find me carrying a camera around. I also like to play video games. I may not be an above-average gamer yet (or ever), but I am definitely working on it!

	<br>
	My research interests lie at the intersection of human cognition and artificial intelligence. I study how the brain processes different levels of visual features, and I leverage these insights to design more effective and cognitively inspired AI systems. I was born in Beijing, a city where thousands of years of history meet modern life, and I love teaching people how to speak 地道的北京话 (the real Beijing way of speaking). Outside the lab, you can usually find me on the tennis or basketball court, behind a camera, or enjoying a Broadway musical.

	<b>Stephanie Lu</b>
	<br>
	<i> Cognitive Science (concentration in AI) and Human-Computer Interaction
	</i>
	<br>
	 Hello! I am an undergraduate student from New Jersey at Carnegie Mellon University studying Cognitive Science with a concentration in AI and an additional major of Human-Computer Interaction. My research interests are at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human social cognition, and I am specifically fascinated by how neural networks are able to perform on more complex tasks such as facial recognition. When I am not in the lab, I am most likely reading fiction, running around Pittsburgh, or eating with my friends!
