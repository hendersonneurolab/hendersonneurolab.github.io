We are a computational neuroscience lab in the [Psychology Department](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/) and [Neuroscience Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/) at Carnegie Mellon University, led by Dr. Maggie Henderson. We are also affiliated with the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/)) and the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/).

Our lab aims to understand the neural and computational basis of human visual cognition. How do we extract meaningful, high-level information from noisy visual inputs? How does this process take into account the statistical structure of the world we live in? 
How does visual processing adapt to changes in our goals and internal state? 

To address these questions, we leverage experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral studies performed with healthy human participants. On the computational side, we build and use machine learning models to understand fMRI and behavioral data. We also perform simulated experiments in artificial neural network models, which aim to uncover theoretical principles of visual processing.
